# Facetracking

Hereâ€™s a basic README template for your face-tracking servo project. This template includes sections for project setup, hardware requirements, and usage instructions. Feel free to modify any part according to your project specifics.

Face Tracking with Raspberry Pi and Servo Motor
This project uses a Raspberry Pi and a servo motor to create a face-tracking system. The system detects a face in the camera feed and adjusts the servo motor's position to keep the face centered in the frame. This is achieved through computer vision using OpenCV, making it ideal for learning about object tracking, computer vision, and basic servo control.

Features
Detects faces in real-time using OpenCV
Controls a servo motor to track and center the detected face in the frame
Can be adapted to track other objects with minor modifications

Hardware Requirements
Raspberry Pi 4 (or other compatible model)
USB camera or Raspberry Pi camera module
Servo motor (e.g., SG90)
